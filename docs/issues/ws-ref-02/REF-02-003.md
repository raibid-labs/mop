# REF-02-003: gRPC Service - Create gRPC Client for Testing

## Context
Implement a gRPC client for the AuthService to enable testing, demonstrations, and load generation. Client should support all RPC methods including streaming calls.

## Requirements
- [ ] Implement gRPC client with connection management
- [ ] Add methods for all AuthService RPCs
- [ ] Support server streaming (StreamEvents)
- [ ] Add CLI interface for manual testing
- [ ] Implement context handling and timeouts
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Support TLS/mTLS configuration (optional)
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Create example usage scripts

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Client connects to server successfully
2. All unary RPCs callable from client
3. Server streaming RPC works correctly
4. CLI allows interactive testing
5. Timeouts and retries work as configured
6. Error handling displays meaningful messages
7. Unit tests verify client behavior
8. Example scripts demonstrate usage
9. Documentation explains client usage

## Clarifying Questions

**Q1: Should client be a library or CLI tool?**
- Default: Both - library for programmatic use, CLI for manual testing

**Q2: What retry strategy should we implement?**
- Default: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries

**Q3: Should we support connection pooling?**
- Default: Single connection for simplicity (demonstrate in tests)

## Technical Notes

### Files to Create
```
cmd/client/main.go               # CLI client
internal/client/auth_client.go   # Client library
examples/client_usage.go         # Usage examples
```

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests with mock gRPC server
- Integration tests with real server
- Test all RPC methods
- Test streaming behavior
- Test error handling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Client library implemented
- [ ] CLI tool functional
- [ ] All RPCs testable
- [ ] Unit tests passing (80%+)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] PR merged
